# Class-Conditioned-Attention-Enhanced-Seq2Seq-Sketch-Generator
End-to-end PyTorch pipeline for class-conditioned vector sketch generation. QuickDraw NDJSON is Δ-sequence converted, augmented, and standardized. A Seq2Seq LSTM encoder–decoder uses class embeddings and dot-product attention. Includes custom loss, early stopping, inference, and visualizers.
